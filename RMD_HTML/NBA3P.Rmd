I was interested in how Three-Point attmepts correlated to W/L% by era, so I made a chart showing the rSquared value of three different Three-Point statistics over 5 year periods since the 1981-1982 Season.

Below is the same information but season-by-season and in table form. It also includes the 1979-1980 and 1980-81 Season. 1979-80 is the first season to introduce Three-Pointers.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
NBAdata = read.csv("C:\\Users\\James\\Downloads\\NBAStats5.csv")
Seasons <- sort(unique(NBAdata$Season))
options(scipen = 999)
rSquaredDF <- data.frame(Season=factor(),
                         RSquared3PTS=numeric(), RSquared3PA.1=numeric(), RSquared3PP=numeric())
for(i in Seasons){
  
  
  Wins3PTS.lm<-lm(X3P.TS ~W.L.,data=subset(NBAdata,Season==i))
  Wins3PA.1.lm<-lm(X3PA.1 ~W.L.,data=subset(NBAdata,Season==i))
  Wins3PPlm<-lm(X3PP ~W.L.,data=subset(NBAdata,Season==i))
  #aquires the RSquared Score
  r2Score3PTS<-summary(Wins3PTS.lm)$adj.r.squared
  r2Score3PA.1 <-summary(Wins3PA.1.lm)$adj.r.squared
  r2Score3PP  <-summary(Wins3PPlm)$adj.r.squared
  RRowDF<-data.frame(Season=c(i),RSquared.3PTS=c(r2Score3PTS),RSquared.3PA.1 = r2Score3PA.1, RSquared3PP = r2Score3PP  )
  rSquaredDF <- rbind(RRowDF, rSquaredDF)
  rSquaredDF <- rSquaredDF[dim(rSquaredDF)[1]:1,]
}
colnames(rSquaredDF)= c("Season", "3P/Total_Shots","3PA_Per_Game", "3P%" )
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
rSquaredDF <- rSquaredDF[order(rSquaredDF$Season ),]
print(rSquaredDF, row.names = FALSE)

```
